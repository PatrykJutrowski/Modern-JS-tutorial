In this chapter we will talk about promises chaining 
Chaining in JavaScript is about connecting multiple enemies together (#promise). Thanks to the fact that we will get a result that will be used.

That means we can create many promises, if callback is not returned so undefined will be displayed.
Promises will be only together when we didnt end the line with symbol ; in other hand if we do it there will be no more promise chaining because The semicolon in JavaScript is used to separate statements.

Chaining is done using the then() function.

method .then() returns a promise for the completion of which ever callback is executed
