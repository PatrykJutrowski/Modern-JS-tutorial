In this tutorial we will learn about Async/await

We use the async keyword with a function to represent that the function is an asynchronous function. The async function returns a promise.

The await keyword is used inside the async function to wait for the asynchronous operation.

Benefits of Using async Function

  1) The code is more readable than using a callback or a promise.
  2) Error handling is simpler.
  3) Debugging is easier.

Error handling 

In the case of error handling with async/await, we can use the try/catch construct inside which we will try to perform some operations. If they fail, we'll take over the error message in the catch section
