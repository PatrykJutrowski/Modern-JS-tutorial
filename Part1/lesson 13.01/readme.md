Modules

What is modules?

Modules are the piece or chunk of a JavaScript code written in a file. JavaScript modules help us to modularize the code simply by partitioning the entire code into modules that can be imported from anywhere. Modules make it easy to maintain the code, debug the code, and reuse the piece of code.

JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.

This makes it easier to maintain the code-base.

JavaScript modules rely on the import and export statements.

Export

You can export a function or variable from any file.

Let us create a file named person.js, and fill it with the things we want to export.

There are two types of exports: Named and Default.

Import

You can import modules into a file in two ways, based on if they are named exports or default exports.

Named exports are constructed using curly braces. Default exports are not.
