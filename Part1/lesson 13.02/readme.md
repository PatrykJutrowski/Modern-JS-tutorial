In this chapter we will talk about Export and Import

Implementation of Export in JavaScript

A keyword “export” is required whenever we export the data of one file to another file. Using the keyword “export” we can export anything like a variable, function, or class to any other file. What we have to do is, simply write the “export” keyword prior to that variable, function, class, or anything we want to export.

Implementation of Import in JavaScript

In JavaScript, the keyword “import” is used whenever we import anything from a file. We have to write the “import” keyword before anything we want to import from some other file.

To better understand the concept we consider some examples and implement them in JavaScript.
