In this chapter we will expalin to us what is Dynamic Imports

How To Use Dynamic Module Import?

Dynamic module imports are very similar to static module imports, but the code is loaded only when it is needed instead of being loaded right away. This means your page load speed will be much quicker and the user will only ever load JavaScript code that they are actually going to use.

Why Use Dynamic Module Imports?

As you can see, converting from a static to a dynamic import is pretty easy, but why would you want to do this:
  1) Initial Page Load Speed
  2) Prevent Unnecessary Polyfill Downloads
  3) Internationalization

Conclusion

These are just a few of the amazing use cases for dynamic module imports and I am sure you can think of even more for your specific applications. Overall, I think dynamic imports are incredible at speeding up your page load and only forcing the user to download the exact JavaScript they need at that moment.
