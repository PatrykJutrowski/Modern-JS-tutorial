What is currying?

Practical examples of currying in JavaScript. Why currying is useful in programming. How to create curried functions.

urrying transforms a function with multiple arguments into a sequence/series of functions each taking a single argument.

So a function like func(a,b,d) can be transformed into func(a)(b)(d).

Currying takes advantage of closures by creating functions that return other functions. Because these functions have persistent memories, we are able to access variables “outside” of nested functions.
Why should I use currying?

There are several reasons why currying is ideal:

  1) Currying is a checking method to make sure that you get everything you need before you proceed
  2) It helps you to avoid passing the same variable again and again
  3) It divides your function into multiple smaller functions that can handle one responsibility. This makes your function pure and less prone to errors and side effects
  4) It is used in functional programming to create a higher-order function
  5) This could be personal preference, but I love that it makes my code readable
