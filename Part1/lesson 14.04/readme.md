In this chapter we will talk about reference types.

What is Reference Type?

A reference type refers to an object in some external memory space. This is in contrast to value types, that are stored where they created. Experts also talks about reference types as being dynamically allocated.

Reference Types
A reference type can contain other values. Since the contents of a reference type can not fit in the fixed amount of memory available for a variable, the in-memory value of a reference type is the reference itself (a memory address).

  1) Array
  2) Object
  3) Function

Reference types are also known as: complex types or container types.
