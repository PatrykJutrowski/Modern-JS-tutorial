Conditional branching: if/else, '?'
In this lesson we will learn something about statements.
The if/else statement executes the block of code if the result is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed.
if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
