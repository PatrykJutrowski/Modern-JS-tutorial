Today we will learn some things about For / While loop
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
For  loop is used to check the given specific condition, and the program is run until the desired condition is met.

 While loop is also used for the repeated execution of a statement.
In this loop, the number of iterations can be infinite unless the given statement is reached or satisfied.
