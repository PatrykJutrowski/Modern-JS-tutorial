In this tutorial we will learn few things about Functions what they are and what they are used for.
Functions would be a set of code that you write and do tasks, for example:
grab food, buy food, eat food, so function store our tasks that we want to do.
In functions we are using something like parameters and local variables. 
Local variables are stored in a function but we have something like global variables that are out of function but usually we trying  to avoid them
beacause of global variables are easily overwritten by other scripts.
Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions.
At the end if we want to execute our code we have to callout our function.
