In this tutorial we will learn about function expression 
Function expression is a anonymus function (function without a name) that can be stored in a variable 
Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.
Usually we are not using that type of function because preferable is Function declaration (function with given name).
Because Function Declaration gives us more flexible and readable code. 
Summary :
We learn that function expressions are a anaonymus function stored in a variable and call out with a variable name.
