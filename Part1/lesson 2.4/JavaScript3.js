let name = "John";
document.write(name)//displayed John
name = "John";

document.write(name)// here is an example that if we want to use the same name of variable we can't use keyword let
//becasue it's already declared and name displayed will be Patrick, because keyword "let" can be changed

const movie = "Fast and furious";

//there will be an error  : movie = 'Batman'; // error, can't reassign the constant!
