In this lesson we will learn about Comparsions: 
From math we know Comparsions like :
a > b  greater,  a <b  less, Equals: a == b, Not equals a != b.
Every comparsions gives us a boolean result like true/false 
Even we have undefined comparsions but in this case we leave the usage of undefined to the JavaScript compiler.
We are using strings that  are compared letter-by-letter in the “dictionary” order.
Every example will be displayed in Javascript program.
