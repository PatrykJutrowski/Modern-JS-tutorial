In this tutorial we will learn about polyfills and traspilers:
A polyfill tries to emulate specific methods,
so you can use them as if they were already supported by the browser (or node engine),
on the other hand, A transpiler will modify your code and replace code by other code that does the same,
which can then be executed in old browsers.

So you can use a polyfill if your target browser did not implement the feature you need to use.
A transpiler, on the other hand, is more complex and will let you use the new language syntax and transforming your source code.
