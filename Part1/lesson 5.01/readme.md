Methods of primitives;
There is a 7 primitive types like string,number, boolean,bigInt,  symbol, null and undefined.
Just remember  primitives are not objects.They canâ€™t store additional data.
In programming, data types is an important concept.
To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type. 
Without data types, a computer cannot solve many things.
JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types
