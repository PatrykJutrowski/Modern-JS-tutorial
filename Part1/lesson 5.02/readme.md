In this lesson we will learn about Numbers data type:
In javascript the number data type can handle two kinds of numeric data type
JavaScript has only one type of numbers.
Numbers can be written with, or without decimals
Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponential) notation (uploaded example)
Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits.
The JavaScript interpreter works from left to right.
First 10 + 20 is added because x and y are both numbers.
Then 30 + "30" is concatenated because z is a string.
NaN is a JavaScript reserved word indicating that a number is not a legal number. NaN not a number
Infinity (or -Infinity) is the value JavaScript will return if you calculate a number outside the largest possible number.
numbers can also be defined as objects with the keyword new
Do not create Number objects.
The new keyword complicates the code and slows down execution speed.
