Introduction to arrays:
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value (like in my example)
Array indexes start with 0.
[0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.
Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.
But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.
Arrays use numbers to access its "elements".
JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.
Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.
You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array.
And we can add elements to our lists, pop, filter and much more even go through the loop.
