This tutorial will be about array methods:
first is The splice() method adds and/or removes array elements.
The splice() method overwrites the original array.
The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) 
where starts represent the index like end in array.
The concat() method is used to merge two or more arrays. This method does not change the existing arrays, but instead returns a new array.
The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element.
The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.
The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function.
If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.
The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the reference to the same array, now sorted. 
The reverse() method first array becomes last and last first etc..
