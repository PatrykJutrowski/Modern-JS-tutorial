This tutorial will be about Destructuring assignement:
The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays,
or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
Destructuring is an operation you can do without, however, you can already see how it makes you a better developer.
Cleaner code, fewer repetitions and more structure over what you have.
We can use it to loop through a key-value pair variable like an object or map
