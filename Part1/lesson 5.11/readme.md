Date and time 
JavaScript Date Objects let us work with dates:
Year,month,hours etc...
Date objects are static. The "clock" is not "running".
The computer clock is ticking, date objects are not.
Date objects are created with the new Date() constructor.
JavaScript stores dates as number of milliseconds
When a date object is created, a number of methods allow you to operate on it.
Date methods allow you to get and set the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond of date objects, using either local time or UTC time
