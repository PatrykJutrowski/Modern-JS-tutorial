JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.
When storing data, the data has to be a certain format, and regardless of where you choose to store it, text is always one of the legal formats.
JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text.
JSON supports following data types:
Objects { ... }
Arrays [ ... ]
Primitives:
strings,
numbers,
boolean values true/false,
null.
The toJSON() function is an important tool when building classes in JavaScript. It is how you control how JavaScript serializes your class into JSON.
The toJSON() function can help you solve numerous problems, like making sure dates or Node.js buffers get serialized in the right format for your app.
