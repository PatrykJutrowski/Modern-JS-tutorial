Recursion and stack
What is recursion?
The process in which a function calls itself is called recursion.
This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.
Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.
The corresponding function is called a recursive function.
A recursive function usually has two parts -  the base case (or stopping condition) and the recursive call to itself.
The base case is the condition in which the function should stop 'recursing'.
The recursive call is a function's call to itself, usually while passing in slightly different arguments that 'work down' towards the base case,
is a condition that stops the recursion.
