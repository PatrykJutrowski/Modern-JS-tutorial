The old "var":
In this chapter, we represent the old scripts. It’s not about writing new codes.
Let’s start at the very beginning.
As you have already learned, there are three main ways for variable declaration:
const
let
var
The var originates from ancient times and is different from the other 2. In general, it is not used in modern scripts.
var may seem similar to let, as it can declare a variable.
var variables have no block scope, their visibility is scoped to current function, or global, if declared outside function.
