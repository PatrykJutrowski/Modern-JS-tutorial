In JavaScript, functions are called Function Objects because they are objects. Just like objects,
functions have properties and methods, they can be stored in a variable or an array, and be passed as arguments to other functions.
As mentioned, functions are objects. You can work with functions as if they were objects.
For example, you can assign functions to variables, to array elements, and to other objects.
They can also be passed around as arguments to other functions or be returned from those functions.
The only difference with objects is that functions can be called.
