In this tutorial we will talk about Prototypal inheritance:
__proto__ is a way to inherit properties from an object in JavaScript.
__proto__ a property of Object.prototype is an accessor property that exposes the [[Prototype]] of the object through which it is accessed.
This __proto__ sets all properties of the object set in its [[Prototype]] to the target object.
__proto__ can be used to inherit properties from an object of JS classes defined with class.
__proto__ is very powerful. Its ability to collect properties for us is unparalleled.
