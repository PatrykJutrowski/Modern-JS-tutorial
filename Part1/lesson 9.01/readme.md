Basic class syntax: 
in this tutorial, you’ll learn about the JavaScript class and how to use it effectively.
To mimic a class, you often use the constructor/prototype pattern
Use the JavaScript class keyword to declare a new class.
A class declaration is syntactic sugar over prototypal inheritance with additional enhancements.
Syntactic sugar is a term for a more concise syntax that provides the same functionality for something that already exists.
In a JavaScript class, getters and setters are used to get or set the properties values.
“get” is the keyword utilized to define a getter method for retrieving the property value,
whereas “set” defines a setter method for changing the value of a specific property. 
When we want to access a property of our JavaScript object, the value returned by the getter method is used, and to set a property value,
the setter method is invoked and then we pass the value as an argument that we want to set.
