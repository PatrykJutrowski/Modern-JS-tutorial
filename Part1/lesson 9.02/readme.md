Class inheritance:
Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more.
Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class.
Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability.
To use class inheritance, you use the extends keyword.
A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class
When overriding a constructor we use method super():
The super keyword can be used in two ways: as a "function call" (super(...args)), or as a "property lookup" (super.prop and super[expr]).
