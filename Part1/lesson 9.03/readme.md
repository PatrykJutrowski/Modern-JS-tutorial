Static methods and objects:
Static class methods are defined on the class itself.
You cannot call a static method on an object, only on an object class.
A static method in JavaScript is a method that has a static keyword prepended to itself.
Such methods cannot be accessed through instantiated objects but could be accessed through the class name.
This is because static methods belong to the class directly. Inheritance even applies to static methods.
