Class checking "instanceof"
we will learn what is instanceof
Syntax and explanation
Why do we need instanceof in JavaScript?

What is instanceof? 
The JavaScript instanceof operator is used to check the type of an object at the run time. It returns a boolean value(true or false). If the returned value is true, then it indicates that the object is an instance of a particular class and if the returned value is false then it is not.

Syntax and explanation
Syntax:

let myVar = objectName instanceof objectType
Parameters:

objectName: Signifies the name of the object.

Why do we need instanceof in JavaScript?
In JavaScript when we declare a variable, we don't explicitly define a type. i.e. we just use var xyz; which could be a string, number, array, or a user-defined datatype as opposed to other languages, for example, in C or C+ we specify the datatype while declaring a variable i.e. int i; float f, etc. Hence, having instanceof operator to check if an object belongs to a certain specified type would be useful in JavaScript.
