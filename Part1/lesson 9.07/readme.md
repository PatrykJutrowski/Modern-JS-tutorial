In this tutorial we will talk about Mixins
A mixin is a class whose methods are added to, or mixed in, with another class.
A base class includes the methods from a mixin instead of inheriting from it. This allows you to add to or augment the behavior of the base class by adding different mixins to it.

This topic contains information on how you can use JavaScript mixins to overwrite component methods.
