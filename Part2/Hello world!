FIRST PROGRAM : 
In this tutorial we are creating our first program
The first thing is we have to use our IDE webstorm/phpstorm or whatever you want. 
IDE is the environment which helps us to build websites/apps and other stuff like that
Lets get started
1. First thing is that we have to create our html file named index and file with ending .js you can name your file FirstProgram
2. Second thing we have to add <script></script> tag which contain  path where is our file like <script src = Firstprogram.js></script>
so it will be like that:
HTML : 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>quiz app</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="quiz.css">
    <script src="Firstprogram.js" ></script>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>

and our Js content looks like this :
alert("Hello World")

The alert () method in JavaScript is used to display a virtual alert box. Like something just happen and your browser infroming you about that etc.
The last thing is that we can add some text without an alert and it will be look like this:
document.write("My message");

Everything about methods and what we are using for will be in next tutorials

SUMMARY : 
We learn how to open our IDE and create files with it and how to add path in our HTML file to first program with js through the browser
And we know how to put an alert method in js file which infroms us about something just happen
