Node properties: type, tag and contents

Summary

To sum up, we can state that every DOM node belongs to a particular class. The classes, on their turn, represent a hierarchy. The set of methods and properties is the result of inheritance. The main DOM properties are nodeType,nodeName/tagName,innerHTML,outerHTML,nodeValue/data, textContent,hidden. There are also additional properties that depend on their class.
