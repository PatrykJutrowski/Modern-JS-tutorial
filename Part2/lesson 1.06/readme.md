Today we will talk about Attributes and properties

What are attributes and properties?

Property used when value doesn't change very often (usually used at startup or for environment variable) Attributes is a value (object child) of an Element (object) which can change very often/all the time and be or not persistent.

  1) Attributes – is what’s written in HTML.
  2) Properties – is what’s in DOM objects.
