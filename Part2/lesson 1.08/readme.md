Styles and classes:

Modifying Classes
The class attribute corresponds to CSS class selectors. This is not to be confused with ES6 classes, a special type of JavaScript function.

CSS classes are used to apply styles to multiple elements, unlike IDs which can only exist once per page. In JavaScript, we have the className and classList properties to work with the class attribute.


Modifying Styles

The style property represents the inline styles on an HTML element. Often, styles will be applied to elements via a stylesheet as was done previously in this article, but sometimes you will have to add or edit an inline style directly.

Conclusion

HTML elements often have additional information assigned to them in the form of attributes. Attributes may consist of name/value pairs, and a few of the most common attributes are class and style.

In this tutorial, you will  learn how to access, modify, and remove attributes on an HTML element in the DOM using plain JavaScript. You also learn how to add, remove, toggle, and replace CSS classes on an element, and how to edit inline CSS styles. For additional reading, check out the documentation on attributes on the Mozilla Developer Network.
