Prevent Default Explained in JavaScript | e.preventDefault()

The Event.preventDefault method in JavaScript allows you to prevent the default behaviour from occurring when an event gets fired off - this is going to change depending on the element and context. For example, when dealing with links (anchor elements), the default behaviour would be to redirect to the URL, but with preventDefault() we are able to prevent this from happening.
