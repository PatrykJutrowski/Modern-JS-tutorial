What are Javascript pointer events?

Pointer events are DOM events that are fired for a pointing device. They are designed to create a single DOM event model to handle pointing input devices such as a mouse, pen/stylus or touch (such as one or more fingers). The pointer is a hardware-agnostic device that can target a specific set of screen coordinates.

The PointerEvent() constructor creates a new synthetic and untrusted PointerEvent object instance.
