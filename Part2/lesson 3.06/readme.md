JavaScript scroll

The onscroll event in JavaScript occurs when a scrollbar is used for an element. The event is fired when the user moves the scrollbar up or down. We can use the CSS overflow property for creating a scrollbar.

In HTML, we can use the onscroll attribute and assign a JavaScript function to it. We can also use the JavaScript's addEventListener() method and pass a scroll event to it for greater flexibility.

In JavaScript

object.onscroll = function() { myScript };

In JavaScript by using the addEventListener() method

object.addEventListener("scroll", myScript);
