Forms: event and method submit:

Submit event:

You can use the "submit" event in JavaScript to react to when the user submits an HTML form. This can be useful when you want to use AJAX for your form processing.

The HTML DOM Form submit() method is used for submitting the form data to the address specified by the action attribute. It acts as a submit button to submit form data and it doesnâ€™t take any kind of parameters.
