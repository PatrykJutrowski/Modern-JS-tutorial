In this tutorial you will learn about    DOMContentLoaded, load, beforeunload, unload

The DOMContentLoaded explainetion: 

The DOMContentLoaded event fires when the DOM content is loaded, without waiting for images and stylesheets to finish loading.
Only handle DOMContentLoaded event if you place the JavaScript code in the head, which references elements in the body section.

onload Event - The onload event occurs when an object has been loaded.

onunload Event - The onunload event occurs once a page has unloaded (or the browser window has been closed).

onbeforeunload Event - The onbeforeunload event occurs when the document is about to be unloaded.
This event allows you to display a message in a confirmation dialog box to inform the user whether he/she wants to stay or leave the current page.

Document.readystate - The Document.readyState property describes the loading state of the document. When the value of this property changes, a readystatechange event fires on the document object.
